                                <p>
                                    According to Islamic Sharia, a person is considered innocent until evidence proves them guilty. The plaintiff and defendants are equal before the court. However, certain crimes, such as murder, adultery, theft, apostasy, fornication and homosexuality, result in definite penalties. The basis of all legal systems in the the UAE is Sharia or Quranic Law. In the constitutions, Islam is identified as the state religion as well as the principal source of law. However, although the principles of Sharia influence criminal and civil laws, the direct influence of of Sharia in the UAE is primarily confined to social laws, such as family law, divorce or succession.

                                <p>
                                    UAE law also allows foreign nationals to divorce under the law of their homeland.

                                </p>

                                <p>Divorce under the UAE law is primarily dealt by Federal Law Number 28 of 2005 (the Personal Status Law – PSL). Certain provisions of Federal Law No.5 of 1985 (the Civil Code) also deliberate the issue. Originally under Shari’ah law six types of divorce were recognized, but modern family legislation recognizes only the following three types of divorce:</p>
                                <br>
                                <hr>
                                <h5>A – Talaq – Divorce by Husband</h5>
                                <p>In talaq there are four stages including initiation, reconciliation, completion and the aftermath. The initiation stage commences immediately on the husband pronouncing the phrase “I divorce you”. For the divorce to be official, three months have to elapse (without intercourse between the couple). This is known as the reconciliation stage whereby the couple have the opportunity to reconcile and, if they do not they may attend court. The completion phase begins thereafter – the wife becomes “non-Mahram” to the husband and the pair must observe hijab rules. The aftermath is the final stage, which includes the husband caring for and supporting any children born of the union.</p>
                                <br>
                                <hr>
                                <h5>B – Khula- Redemptive divorce or divorce by mutual agreement</h5>
                                <p>n Khula the wife has the right to seek a divorce from her husband through the mutual consent of the husband or a judicial decree. It involves a woman paying her husband to gain his permission to allow her out of the marriage. Payment can be monetary or through some service provided to him. Her family might return his dowry – the goods or payment they received in exchange for their daughter as his wife. If he accepts, the divorce can move on to court for the tafriq process as defined below.</p>
                                <br>
                                <hr>
                                <h5>C – Tafriq – Divorce by judicial order</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Tafriq is a form of divorce in which the court intervenes. There are five grounds for valid Tafriq applications: physical or emotional injury, irreconcilable differences, discovery after marriage that the husband has an incurable physical defect (i.e. impotence), and failure to pay maintenance to the wife, or imprisonment or absence without reason by the husband for over one year.

                                </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>The law also lays down certain provisions whereby both spouses may ask for separation if this has been mutually agreed.</p>
                                <br>
                                <hr>
                                <h5>Counseling</h5>
                                <p>Counseling involving a counselor and both the husband and wife. The session shall be focused on discussing whether or not reconciliation will be possible, and after the meeting the counselor will report to the Judge. It is important to note that the judge must be absolutely convinced that the marriage is irreparable in order to further divorce proceedings.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>
                                    Further to the session the couple will be offered a three-month period to reconsider their decision, and if they insist on proceeding thereafter their papers will be forwarded to the court. It is inevitably simpler if the divorce is uncontested with a mutual agreement already in place between the husband and the wife, thus negating the need for the court to impose a settlement arrangement.

                                </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>
                                    If no prejudice is proved but disagreement continues between the spouses without the family guidance committee or the judge being able to propose a resolution, the judge shall appoint two arbitrators (from their respective families if possible) by no later than the following session. When appointing the arbitrators the judge shall also issue a timeline which shall not exceed 90 days, and shall lay out the date by which the task must be completed. This period may later be extended by a court decision. The two arbitrators shall investigate the causes of dissension and exert their efforts to conciliate the spouses. The arbitrators shall submit a report to the judge and the judge may, if he so desires, base his judgment on the arbitrators’ decision. However it is highly likely that if the arbitrators have failed to conciliate the spouses, the divorce shall be granted. It is therefore evident that regardless of the legislative system applied, the emphasis of divorce proceedings in the UAE is on the encouragement of reconciliation.

                                </p>
                                <div></div>

                                    The maintenance amount is calculated in accordance with the husband’s financial stability and status. If the husband divorces his wife at his exclusive wish, she shall be entitled to enjoyment maintenance plus the waiting period maintenance depending on the husband’s condition and subject to a maximum of the maintenance of her equals. The judge may allow the payment in installments depending on the husband’s financial capacity, however he shall also consider the way in which any payment schedule would impact the wife.

                                </p>

                                    Under UAE law a father is regarded as the natural guardian of a child. A distinction is made between a “custodian” and “guardian”– a guardian is bound by the duties of financially maintaining a child and making any decision with regards to his or her education and upbringing. 1A custodian, as the word suggests, has the actual custody of the child and is obliged to raise him or her whilst ensuring all day to day needs are met In deciding on such matters the courts of the UAE will primarily consider the age of the child and the mental state of the parents. The law nonetheless lays down certain conditions to be fulfilled by either of the spouses in order to be granted child custody. The law requires the person to be a mature adult of sound mind, honest, capable of raising, caring for and attending to the child, free of serious infectious disease, and free from criminal convictions.

                                <p>
                                    Further, there are additional guidelines to be satisfied according to gender of the person seeking custody.

                                </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>
                                    As for men, the law requires that the household must encompass a woman (such as a grandmother or aunt) fit to be custodian of the child, to be “Muhrem” if the child is female. This woman must be of the same religion as the child.

                                </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>
                                    Even in cases whereby two parents are married to each other, in the event of death of the husband the custody of the child becomes a subject of concern. Following the death, the child shall be taken into institutional care until the court hears the matter and (most likely) passes guardianship to the mother. In order to avoid the removal of the child from the mother’s care in such situations the assigning of an interim guardian is crucial. Therefore it is vital that a father includes in his will (or in a separate, endorsed and legally-binding document) an interim child custody agreement, affirming that the child shall be under the guardianship of the surviving parent or any other family member nominated in the agreement until the formal guardianship order is passed by the court.

                                    Whether contested or agreed by mutual consent, matters such as divorce and child custody are universally acknowledged as being delicate issues. Indeed, “Stress Scale” specifies divorce as being one of the most stressful life events a person can go through. It is therefore essential that the practical steps are handled in an efficient, sensitive and case-appropriate manner in order to ensure a smooth and effective resolution for all parties involved. Salha Albasti welcomes all enquiries pertaining to family matters, and ensures to afford every enquiry the respect and sensitivity that each family deserves.

                                <h5>WHY THERE IS A NEED OF A WILL IN THE UAE?</h5>
                                <p>The UAE courts would adhere to Sharia law in respect of the distribution of assets of a non-Muslim UAE expat where he or she dies without a Will in place (which is known as dying “intestate”). As a way out, Article 17(1) of the UAE Civil Code states that the inheritance shall be governed by the law of the deceased at the time of his death. The law allows a non-Muslim foreigner to choose the laws of his or her home country to apply to his or her inheritance. </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>
                                    For non-Muslim expatriates who don’t have a will, there is a likelihood that Sharia law or forced rules on inheritors will apply. The court may also decide on who takes care of the surviving children upon the untimely death of the parent/s. If the expatriate has assets outside the UAE, he could lose a huge proportion of his inheritance to excessive taxes.
                                </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>“If you want the right money in the right hands at the right time, the starting point is a properly executed last will and testament, without which your dependents may be in dire straits for some considerable time before assets are released,</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>“Worse, without a statement about guardians for the children, courts have no reason to follow what might seem reasonable, and may make decisions that leave children with grandparents or others whom the parents may never have wanted.”</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>That a valid will is required in every jurisdiction where there are assets. So, someone with properties in the UK and France and bank accounts in the Isle of Man and UAE, already has four jurisdictions for his executors to deal with.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>If a non-expatriate Muslim in the UAE has assets in the country and abroad, it is advisable to get an international will or a similar document from their home country.</p>

                                <div></div>
                                <p>Sharia inheritance provisions are a form of forced heir ship which is used in a number of countries, however in the UAE, the Sharia provisions will tend to pass a much greater share of the estate to the male bloodline. The female spouse, for example, may only receive one eighth of the estate held in the UAE,”</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>“Additionally, your surviving family will have the extra problem that your Dubai, Abu Dhabi or UAE-based assets are likely to be frozen while the local legal system works through the process of assessing debts that need paying from your estate. The delay might be a couple of years or so getting all these matters dealt with the property and bank. The consequences are grave like Furthermore where business owners are concerned, be it in the free zone or LLC, in the event of a shareholder or director’s death, local probate laws apply and shares do not pass automatically by survivorship nor can a family member take over in lieu. There are also issues regarding guardianship of bereaved children.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>It is prudent to have a will to protect your assets and children and be prepared today for all that may and can happen tomorrow.</p>
