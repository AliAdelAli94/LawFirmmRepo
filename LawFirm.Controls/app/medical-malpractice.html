A request could be made before the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) to identify and appoint an expert medical practitioner to assess a case of medical negligence. In civil claims, reliance was placed the UAE Civil Code and likewise a criminal claim would involve provisions of the UAE Penal Code to determine the performance of a duty. However, it was apparent that there were discrepancies and these ere resulting in application of different principles by the Courts either on a civil or criminal level. Therefore, the implementation of the new law had become essential for the intended development of the medical sector and more so from a legal perspective.
