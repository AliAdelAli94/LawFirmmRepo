                                <h5>What is a Will?</h5>
                                <p>
                                    A will is arguably the most important legal document that you will ever create in your life. A Will (i) directs how your property will be managed and distributed and; (ii) provides for the care of your minor children, after your death. If you are a non-Muslim expat in the UAE, a validly written Will could be the only possible way to expect your wishes to be respected in respect of your assets in the UAE.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <hr>
                                <h5>WHY THERE IS A NEED OF A WILL IN THE UAE?</h5>
                                <p>The UAE courts would adhere to Sharia law in respect of the distribution of assets of a non-Muslim UAE expat where he or she dies without a Will in place (which is known as dying “intestate”). As a way out, Article 17(1) of the UAE Civil Code states that the inheritance shall be governed by the law of the deceased at the time of his death. The law allows a non-Muslim foreigner to choose the laws of his or her home country to apply to his or her inheritance. </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>
                                    For non-Muslim expatriates who don’t have a will, there is a likelihood that Sharia law or forced rules on inheritors will apply. The court may also decide on who takes care of the surviving children upon the untimely death of the parent/s. If the expatriate has assets outside the UAE, he could lose a huge proportion of his inheritance to excessive taxes.
                                </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>“If you want the right money in the right hands at the right time, the starting point is a properly executed last will and testament, without which your dependents may be in dire straits for some considerable time before assets are released,</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>“Worse, without a statement about guardians for the children, courts have no reason to follow what might seem reasonable, and may make decisions that leave children with grandparents or others whom the parents may never have wanted.”</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>That a valid will is required in every jurisdiction where there are assets. So, someone with properties in the UK and France and bank accounts in the Isle of Man and UAE, already has four jurisdictions for his executors to deal with.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>If a non-expatriate Muslim in the UAE has assets in the country and abroad, it is advisable to get an international will or a similar document from their home country.</p>

                                <div></div>
                                <p>Sharia inheritance provisions are a form of forced heir ship which is used in a number of countries, however in the UAE, the Sharia provisions will tend to pass a much greater share of the estate to the male bloodline. The female spouse, for example, may only receive one eighth of the estate held in the UAE,”</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>“Additionally, your surviving family will have the extra problem that your Dubai, Abu Dhabi or UAE-based assets are likely to be frozen while the local legal system works through the process of assessing debts that need paying from your estate. The delay might be a couple of years or so getting all these matters dealt with the property and bank. The consequences are grave like Furthermore where business owners are concerned, be it in the free zone or LLC, in the event of a shareholder or director’s death, local probate laws apply and shares do not pass automatically by survivorship nor can a family member take over in lieu. There are also issues regarding guardianship of bereaved children.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>It is prudent to have a will to protect your assets and children and be prepared today for all that may and can happen tomorrow.</p>

                                <h5>Bank Accounts Frozen At Death</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Yes all bank accounts of the deceased (single or joint) in the UAE are frozen upon death until the court has passed orders in respect of the distribution of assets of the deceased. This is required under article 379 of the code.

                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <h5>Distribution Of Real Estate In The UAE</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Article 17(5) of the Code states that the laws of the UAE shall apply to the Wills made by aliens disposing of their real property in the UAE. A conservative interpretation of the above provisions would mean that the deceased local law will only apply to the moveable assets in the UAE. It is our view that while a Will may not guarantee the outcome that an expatriate intends to have, it could still influence the decision of the court as it is taken into account by the court when deciding on a probate for immoveable assets.
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <h5>Who Is The Executor?</h5>
                                <p>
                                    The executor is the person you will nominate in your Will to be responsible for dividing up the estate and ensuring that your wishes are carried out in accordance with your Will. We recommend that you appoint a minimum of two (2) executors in your Will to ensure that the alternate executor will act in the event where your first choice is unable or unwilling to act at the relevant time
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <h5>Who Can Be A Beneficiary?</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Any individuals or institutions can be beneficiaries in a Will. UAE expats usually make their spouses and children as beneficiaries. Of course, they can also decide to make any charitable institution as one of their beneficiaries.
