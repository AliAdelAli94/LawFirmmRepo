                                <p>
                                    Bankruptcy is a legal status of a person or other entity that cannot repay the debts it owes to creditors. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a court order, often initiated by the debtor.

                                </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Bankruptcy Is Not The Only Legal Status That An Insolvent Person Or Other Entity May Have, And The Term Bankruptcy Is Therefore Not A Synonym For Insolvency.</p>
                                <h5>Debt & Restructuring</h5>
                                <p>The principal focus of modern insolvency legislation and business debt restructuring practices no longer rests on the elimination of insolvent entities but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing financial distress so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of their business.</p>
