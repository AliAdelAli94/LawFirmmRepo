                                <p>UAE’s legislature with the intention to protect interests of family from crimes affecting the families given that these crimes have a long-bearing effect on families in general and communities at large. The above assertion is based on the fact that although a crime may be committed against victim, it is essentially a crime against the community whose law is violated. Part 6 (Article 327 to Article 330) of the UAE Penal Code (Federal Law Number (3) of 1987, as amended) (the Law) dealing with family related offenses is discussed below:-</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Article 327 of the Law aims at protecting interests of families as well legal guardians of a newborn child. It is provided that i) abduction of newborn children from his or her legitimate guardian; ii) concealing a newborn from his/her legitimate guardian; iii) substituting a newborn child with other; or iv) falsely handing over a newborn to persons other than newborn’s legitimate parents will result in imprisonment. Accordingly, the above Article requires involvement of two physical acts – a) it involves a newborn; and b) taking the newborn away from legal custody of its parents or legal guardian making it difficult to recognize the newborn in future. In the event there is evidence to prove that the said child was born dead, the offender will be subject to a two months imprisonment or a fine of up to 1000 Dirhams, or both.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Cases where guardian of a child abstains or refuses to deliver the child to persons legally entitled to the child’s custody pursuant to a court order is discussed under Article 328 of the Law. Guardian’s failure to restore custody to persons legally entitled may result in such guardian’s imprisonment or fine. The degree of punishment falls in the present case and the main reason underlying lower punishment appears to result from the fact that a guardian has fiduciary duty towards the child and in his capacity the guardian has the choice to raise the child as long as the guardian agrees to handover child’s custody to his legitimate parent or guardian as per court order or certificate from relevant authority.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Disputes relating to child custody generally fall within the jurisdiction of the personal affairs court, but matters bearing criminal overtone may be referred to the court of misdemeanors provided however that the claimant holds an enforceable judgment to claim legal custody of the child.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Abduction of minors by parents or grandparents with or without deceptive intent or coercion will result in imprisonment or fine per provisions of Article 329 of the law. In other words, if a parent or grand-parent abducts child or grandchild personally or through others from persons legally entitled to be guardian of the child pursuant to a court order or by a competent authority, such parent or grand-parent will be subject to above punishment. This means that the intention of kidnapper is to bring an end to the legal relationship existing between the child and his/her legal guardian thereby affecting the rights of guardian in terms of child custody laws in the UAE.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Finally, Article 330 deals with situations where persons against whom a judgment towards payment of maintenance or alimony has been pronounced and such persons fail to comply with the terms of said judgment within three months from the date of notice being served. This Article punishes the offender with imprisonment not exceeding one year or fine of AED 1000/- or; both. In the event the offender settles the amount due against him or produces guarantee that is satisfactory to the complainant, the penalty provisions shall not apply to the offender.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>An analysis of Article 330 suggests that these four elements must be involved to constitute a crime:-</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>The complainant must have an enforceable judgment for alimony or maintenance.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>The offender must refuse payment to complainant after a three month warning/notice.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Victim must register a complaint.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>The parties must have submitted a claim before personal status court and exhausted all procedures set forth by the law.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>It is worth mentioning that except for provisions contained in Article 327, the complainants must register a complaint consistent with Article 10 of the UAE Criminal Procedures Code (35 of 1992) which sets out that criminal action must be based on an written or oral complaint by the victim or his/her legal representative and within three months from the date of event in matters relating to a) refusal to handover the custody of children to their legally entitled guardians; and b) refusal of payment of alimony, maintenance, or housing allowance to wife or person named under court order Due to the unique nature of personal status/family cases and resultant unfavorable consequences of delay in deciding about them, we strive to avoid all that lead to such delay in settling the dispute. Thus, we set eye on getting a conclusive decision in the case at the earliest, the good case preparation and support with lawful and legal references, will enable the court to grasp all the legal aspects of the dispute, and, decide about it in a short span of time to the interest of our client. Even when the nationalities of the spouses are different, the work team can effectively deal with the case owing to their high experience and knowledge in handling such cases before competent courts.</p>

                                <p>Blood Money</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>UAE With so many nationalities living here with their different ethnic backgrounds, religions and traditions, it is important for everyone to know about Sharia or the Islamic Law, as it is the law of this Islamic nation.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Ignorance of the law is not a justification in the eyes of the courts.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>The legal system in Dubai is however, a combination of Sharia, civil and criminal laws, while in other emirates only Sharia is implemented.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>According to the Sharia, if one causes the death or injury of another person accidentally or intentionally, he or she has to pay blood money or Diya. The blood money is to be paid to the victim’s family as compensation and the amount is given in accordance with Sharia.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>The (Diya) is also a punishment and a means of protecting the rights of the parents of the victim and is given automatically. The parents do not have to sue for the money. The compensation will be granted by a judge who is in charge of criminal proceedings and he will award the Diya when pronouncing the sentence on the accused.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>The blood money will only be payable if the person who caused the death of another person is found guilty under criminal procedure or legally responsible for committing a wrongful act, offence or crime.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>According to Sharia, the life of a Muslim is evaluated for a larger amount of blood money than people of other religions, faiths or ethnic groups. But in the UAE the blood money is Dh 200,000.00 for all males residing the country, whatever their religion or nationality.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>In Defence</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>The Sharia grants the family of a female, half the amount for a male, which is Dh 100,000. However, it is left to the judge who is in charge of the case to decide the amount of the blood money.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Blood money is not paid if a person kills another while trying to defend himself, his family, his property or other individuals and their property from harm.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>According to UAE law, a person who is keeping an animal, whether he or she is the owners or not, must control that animal and will be legally responsible and have to pay blood money if that animal causes the death of another person.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Also the owner of a building or the manager in a company, factory or any person in charge will be legally responsible for the death of person or persons if the building collapses or of anyone in their charge dies due to negligence on their part.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>If a person who owns equipment or machinery will be liable to charges and payment of diya if the equipment or the machinery causes the death of another person.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>In case the crime was committed by more than one person, each person should pay blood money in accordance to their share of the crime. However, the court may order all persons found legally responsible to pay for the damages equally.</p>
