                                <p>
                                    Our team of lawyers drafts all forms of contracts, agreements, memorandums, deeds, settlements, conveyance. Furthermore, we draft leases, mortgages, sales, articles of association, distribution and arbitration agreements in addition to providing advice on contractual liability and consumer laws.

                                <h5>Types of Contracts</h5>
                                <hr>
                                <h5>Express Contracts</h5>
                                <p>In an express contract, the parties state the terms, either orally or in writing, at the time of its formation. There is a definite written or oral offer that is accepted by the offeree (i.e., the person to whom the offer is made) in a manner that explicitly demonstrates consent to its terms.</p>
                                <h5>Implied Contracts</h5>
                                <p>although contracts that are implied in fact and contracts implied in law are both called implied contracts, a true implied contract consists of obligations arising from a mutual agreement and intent to promise, which have not been expressed in words.</p>
                                <h5>Executed and Executory Contracts</h5>
                                <p>
                                    an executed contract is one in which nothing remains to be done by either party. An executory contract is one in which some future act or obligation remains to be performed according to its terms.
                                </p>
                                <h5>Unilateral contract is usually a one sided contract</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Bilateral Contract a bilateral contract is sometimes called a two sided contract because of the two promises that constitute it. The promise that one party makes constitutes sufficient consideration for the promise made by the other.


                                </p>
                                <h5>
                                    Unconscionable

                                </h5>
                                <p>
                                    unusually harsh and shocking to the conscience; that which is so grossly unfair that a court will proscribe it.
                                </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>When a court uses the word unconscionable to describe conduct, it means that the conduct does not conform to the dictates of conscience. In addition, when something is judged unconscionable, a court will refuse to allow the perpetrator of the conduct to benefit.</p>

                                <h5>Adhesion contracts</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Are those that are drafted by the party who has the greater bargaining advantage, providing the weaker party with only the opportunity to adhere to (i.e., to accept) the contract or to reject it. (These types of contract are often described by the saying “Take it or leave it.”)

                                    <h5>Aleatory Contracts</h5>
                                <p>
                                    An aleatory contract is a mutual agreement the effects of which are triggered by the occurrence of an uncertain event. In this type of contract, one or both parties assume risk. A fire insurance policy is a form of aleatory contract, as an insured will not receive the proceeds of the policy unless a fire occurs, an event that is uncertain to occur.

                                    <h5>Void and Voidable Contracts</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Contracts can be either void or Voidable. A void contract imposes no legal rights or obligations upon the parties and is not enforceable by a court. It is, in effect, no contract at all.

                                    <h5>Duress</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Duress is a wrongful act or threat by one party that compels another party to perform some act, such as the signing of a contract, which he or she would not have done voluntarily, Agreements between two entities, creating an enforceable obligation to do, or to refrain from doing, a particular thing.

                                    <h5>Breach of Contract</h5>
                                <p>
                                    An unjustifiable failure to perform all or some part of a contractual duty constitutes a breach of contract. It ensues when a party who has a duty of immediate performance fails to perform, or when one party hinders or prevents the performance of the other party.
                                    <div></div>
                                <p>
                                    A total, major, material, or substantial breach of contract constitutes a failure to perform properly a material part of the contract. A partial or minor breach of contract is merely a slight deviation from the bargained-for performance. A breach may occur by Anticipatory Repudiation, whereby the promisor, without justification and before committing a breach, makes an affirmative statement to the promise, indicating that he or she will not or cannot perform the contractual duties.

                                </p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>The differences in the types of breach are significant in ascertaining the kinds of remedies and damages available to the aggrieved party.</p>
                                <h5>Remedies</h5>
                                <p>Damages, reformation, Rescission, restitution, and Specific Performance are the basic remedies available for breach of contract. Damages The term damages signifies a sum of money awarded as a compensation for injury caused by a breach of contract. The type of breach governs the extent of the damages to be awarded. Failure to perform the measure of damages in breach-of-contract cases is the sum that would be necessary to recompense the injured party for the amount of losses incurred through breach of contract. The injured party should be placed in the position that he or she would have occupied if the contract had been performed, and they are entitled to receive the benefit of the bargain.
