                                <p>DIAC arbitration or the Dubai International Arbitration Center was established on 7 May 2007. The Center is called to examine the disputes submitted in accordance with the DAIC Rules. When commencing an arbitration, the following steps should be taken :</p>

                                <ul class="list-marked" style="color: #2b2f40">
                                    <li>Making a request for arbitration, including</li>
                                    <li>A demand to refer to the arbitration under the DIAC Rules.</li>
                                    <li>The full name, description, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, and other contact information available.</li>
                                    <li>A copy of the arbitration agreement by the claimant, a copy of the contractual documentation, which contains the mentioned agreement.</li>
                                    <li>A description in brief, stating the circumstances and the nature of the dispute, which has given rise to the given claim.</li>
                                    <li>A preliminary statement related to the relief being sought, to its possible extent, and an indication of the amount claimed.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The request shall be submitted to the DIAC in the number of copies required. The claimant shall make payment of the registration fee, after which the Center shall send a copy of the request and the documents annexed thereto to the respondent. . Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) have proven to provide a more cost-effective settlement to disputes than traditional litigation proceedings.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Salha Albasti Advocates & Legal Consultants has the necessary background and training to ensure an efficient resolution to all disputes allowed to be resolved through arbitration. With our wealth of experienced lawyers, we regularly resolve disputes amicably and expeditiously with the minimum expense and hardship.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>Our firm is distinguished for its advocates and consultants holding international certifications and accredited by both Arab & International Committees. Hence, they are most capable of representing our clients as members of arbitration panels and as pleaders before such panels too, due to their being in constant contact with local and international arbitration centers.</p>
                                <div></div>
                                <p>We need to mention that our keen interest in arbitration derives from the fact that it is a fast means of settling disputes arising between parties, particularly those requiring special expertise in the court to figure out the nature of the relevant dispute. Accordingly, we might advise our client to appoint a certified accountant, engineer or doctor as arbitrator, and then file the case and pleadings to the court or arbitration panel including attending before them to explain the case in simple language with produce all relevant supporting factual & legal evidences, and finally, execute the award passed by the arbitration panel and complete all necessary proceedings of ratification and execution of arbitration awards.</p>
