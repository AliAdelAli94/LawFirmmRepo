                                    &nbsp;In cases where an employee leaves their sponsor’s company before expiration of their contract term, the Ministry of Labor automatically imposes a ban when the employee leaves. In order to lift the ban, the employee must request their last sponsor to issue a No Objection Certificate, or NOC. A request for transfer of sponsorship to a new sponsor, if necessary, should be made to the Ministry of Labor within 1 month of the cancellation of sponsorship, along with the NOC and the requisite fee of AED 200.

                                    &nbsp;In cases where the employer has violated the terms of the employment contract, the Ministry of Labor may lift the work ban without an NOC. The Labor Court must rule in favor of the employee finding that he or she was legally entitled to terminate the contract early or outside of the statutory notice period.
